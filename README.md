# 🧑‍💻 Developer VIEN — Portfolio
### 🔰 Phase 3 — Complete | Phase 4 — In Progress
![Portfolio Background](assets/images/banner.png)

A personal developer portfolio for **Vien Fritzgerald V. Calderon**, built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no backend. Features a dark aesthetic, dual-mode welcome page (Visitor & Developer), and a fully data-driven dashboard powered by Firebase Firestore and GitHub-hosted project metadata.

---

## 🎯 Overview

This portfolio presents Vien's developer life, projects, and background in a clean, interactive format. Visitors browse in read-only mode. Content is managed directly by the developer through an in-dashboard edit mode.

All content (projects, certificates, CV/resume documents, timeline events) is driven by Firestore documents. No data is hardcoded in JavaScript. Projects are fetched automatically from their own GitHub repos via `INFO.json`. Physical files (PDFs, certificate images) are stored in the GitHub repo under `data/files/` and served via `raw.githubusercontent.com`.

> **Note:** All JSON data files have been migrated to Firebase Firestore. The `data/` folder now only holds physical files (PDFs, images). Do not add JSON files back to `data/`.

## ☁️ Firestore Data Structure

All dashboard content is stored in the `portfolio` collection in Firestore. No data is hardcoded in JavaScript.

```
portfolio/
├── credentials     # EmailJS config, auth UIDs, GitHub PAT
├── certs           # Certificate metadata array
├── docs            # CV/Resume metadata arrays (cv + resume)
└── timestamp       # Timeline registry (repo slugs + milestone entries)
```

Each document stores its data under a `data` field. Example for `timestamp`:
```json
{
    "data": [
        { "repo": "devssst/my-portfolio" },
        { "year": 2025, "title": "BSIT - DPLmB", "date": "2025-06", "desc": "..." }
    ]
}
```

Example for `docs`:
```json
{
    "data": {
        "cv": [],
        "resume": [
            {
                "id": "doc-1746432000000",
                "title": "Resume",
                "type": "Resume",
                "uploaded": "2026-05-06",
                "file": "data/files/Resume.pdf"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### INFO.json — place at root of each project repo
```json
{
    "id": "unique-id",
    "name": "Project Name",
    "year": 2026,
    "date": "YYYY-MM",
    "description": "One sentence shown on the card.",
    "about": "Full paragraph shown on expand.",
    "contributions": "Your role and what you built.",
    "stack": ["PROGRAMMING", "LANGUAGE", "STACK"],
    "banner": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickname/your-project-repo/main/assets/images/banner.png",
    "live": "https://nickname.github.io/your-project-repo",
    "source": "https://github.com/nickname/your-project-repo"
}
```
> **banner** must be a full `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL. Relative paths will 404. Omit the field to show the `fa-code` placeholder icon.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Internet connection (for Firestore, GitHub fetch + EmailJS)

### Running
Access the live site: https://devssst.github.io/my-portfolio

### Adding a new project
1. Place an `INFO.json` at the root of the project repo
2. Add a repo entry to `portfolio/timestamp` in Firestore: `{ "repo": "devssst/your-repo" }`
3. Push `INFO.json` — the portfolio auto-fetches and renders the card

### Uploading a document (CV / Resume) — Edit Mode
1. Log in and activate edit mode from the badge dropdown
2. Click the **+ New Document** button that appears in the HOME section
3. Drag and drop or browse for a PDF file
4. Fill in the title and select the document type (Resume or CV)
5. Click Upload — the file is pushed to `data/files/` via the GitHub Contents API and the metadata is saved to Firestore `portfolio/docs` automatically
6. The card renders immediately after upload, no page reload needed

### Deleting a document — Edit Mode
1. Activate edit mode — red X buttons appear on each document card
2. Click the X on the card you want to remove
3. Confirm in the delete dialog — the file is removed from GitHub and the metadata entry is removed from Firestore

### Adding a certificate
Certificates upload/delete via edit mode is planned for Phase 4. For now, add the PNG to `data/files/` manually and add an entry to `portfolio/certs` in Firestore under `data.certificates`.

## 🎨 Design Language

### Color Palette
- **Background**: Python code-art image (`background.png`), `background-attachment: fixed`
- **Overlay**: Single `body::before` — `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75)` + `backdrop-filter: blur(6px)` applied once globally
- **Header**: `rgba(17, 25, 40, 0.80)` with its own `backdrop-filter: blur(8px) saturate(180%)`
- **Cards**: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.001–0.01)` — defined primarily by borders, not fill
- **Accent Purple**: `#a855f7` / `#7c22e8` / `#c026d3`
- **Logo**: Red `#FF2200` V on black
- **Text Primary**: `#ffffff`
- **Text Muted**: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.35–0.65)`

> Per-card `backdrop-filter` is disabled (commented out) for performance. Glassmorphism is achieved via the single global overlay. Commented blocks are left intentionally for future re-enablement.

### Language Bar Colors
- **HTML**: `#E34F26` — **CSS**: `#663399` — **JavaScript**: `#F7DF1E` — **Python**: `#013763` — **Java**: `#E32C2E`

### UI Highlights
- 6-section tab navigation: `home`, `about`, `timeline`, `projects`, `certificates`, `reach`
- Mouse wheel and touch swipe section hijacking (300ms cooldown, 5px threshold) — textarea and open modal scroll excluded
- Profile card smooth slide-out; state synced across all 4 content sections
- Purple scrollbar auto-appears on scroll, fades after 1.5s
- Animated skill bars triggered once on first ABOUT entry
- Clickable stat cards navigate to their section
- Consistent empty states: centered FA icon + muted text

## 📋 Update Logs

### Phase 4 — Documents Edit Mode + PDF Fixes (May 6 2026)
- Documents upload complete: drag-and-drop modal, title + type fields, GitHub Contents API push, Firestore metadata write, in-place re-render after upload
- Documents delete complete: red X per card (edit mode only), confirm modal, GitHub file deletion + Firestore metadata removal
- PDF.js thumbnail now fetches from `raw.githubusercontent.com` — fixes 404 on newly uploaded files before GitHub Pages redeploys
- VIEW button opens the GitHub blob viewer (`github.com/.../blob/main/...`) — renders PDF inline in browser without downloading
- SAVE button fetches the raw URL and triggers a named download via blob — works cross-origin without relying on the `download` attribute
- `cursor: pointer` added to `.doc-card-btn` — was implicit on `<a>` tags, now explicit for button elements

### Phase 3 — Firebase & Firestore Integration (May 5 2026)
- Firebase Authentication integrated — Email/Password + Google Sign-In, dual UID verification
- All JSON data migrated to Firestore `portfolio` collection — `timestamp`, `certs`, `docs`, `credentials` documents
- `data/` folder reduced to `files/` only (PDFs and certificate images)
- `loadAllData()` fully rewritten to use Firestore SDK
- EmailJS credentials now loaded from Firestore at runtime

### Phase 3 — Data Architecture Refinements (May 4 2026)
- `data/projects.json` renamed to `data/timestamp.json` — now accepts both repo slugs and direct timeline entries in the same array
- `TIMELINE_DATA` constant removed from `dashboard.js` entirely — all timeline data now lives in Firestore
- `FETCHED_TIMELINE[]` added as a third data store alongside `FETCHED_PROJECTS[]` and `FETCHED_CERTS[]`
- `renderDocs()` now properly `await`-ed in `boot()` — previously called without await
- EmailJS credentials moved from hardcoded JS constants to Firestore — fetched at runtime, guarded before send
- `certs-sort-btn` filter pills removed from certificates section — company group labels serve as visual separators
- Textarea scroll guard added to wheel hijack handler

### Phase 3 — Full Dashboard (May 3 2026)
- All 6 sections built and functional
- JSON-driven content: projects via `INFO.json` fetch chain, certs via `certs.json`, docs via `docs.json`
- `boot()` async with individual `try/catch` per render — crash isolation
- Profile card collapse synced across ABOUT, TIMESTAMPS, PROJECTS, CERTIFICATES
- EmailJS integrated and confirmed working
- Universal card spec applied to CV/Resume, Projects, Certificates
- Skills bar animation, levels modal, stat card navigation
- Per-element scrollbar Map — fixes shared scroll state bug

### Phase 2 — Dashboard Shell (April 28 2026)
