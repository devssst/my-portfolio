# 🧑‍💻 Developer VIEN — Portfolio
### 🔰 Phase 3 — Complete | Phase 4 — In Progress
![Portfolio Background](assets/images/banner.png)

A personal developer portfolio for **Vien Fritzgerald V. Calderon**, built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no backend. Features a dark aesthetic, dual-mode welcome page (Visitor & Developer), and a fully data-driven dashboard powered by Firebase Firestore and GitHub-hosted project metadata.

---

## 🎯 Overview

This portfolio presents Vien's developer life, projects, and background in a clean, interactive format. Visitors browse in read-only mode. Content is managed directly by the developer.

All content (projects, certificates, CV/resume documents, timeline events) is driven by Firestore documents. No data is hardcoded in JavaScript. Projects are fetched automatically from their own GitHub repos via `INFO.json`.

> **Note:** All JSON data files have been migrated to Firebase Firestore. The `data/` folder now only holds physical files (PDFs, images).

## ☁️ Firestore Data Structure

All dashboard content is stored in the `portfolio` collection in Firestore. No data is hardcoded in JavaScript.

```
portfolio/
├── credentials     # EmailJS service configuration
├── certs           # Certificate metadata array
├── docs            # CV/Resume metadata array
└── timestamp       # Timeline registry (repo slugs + milestone entries)
```

Each document stores its data under a `data` field. Example for `timestamp`:
```json
{
    "data": [
        { "repo": "devssst/my-portfolio" },
        { "year": 2025, "title": "BSIT - DPLmB", "date": "2025-06", "desc": "..." }
    ]
}
```

### INFO.json — place at root of each project repo
```json
{
    "id": "unique-id",
    "name": "Project Name",
    "year": 2026,
    "date": "YYYY-MM",
    "description": "One sentence shown on the card.",
    "about": "Full paragraph shown on expand.",
    "contributions": "Your role and what you built.",
    "stack": ["PROGRAMMING", "LANGUAGE", "STACK"],
    "banner": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickname/your-project-repo/main/assets/images/banner.png",
    "live": "https://nickname.github.io/your-project-repo",
    "source": "https://github.com/nickname/your-project-repo"
}
```
> **banner** must be a full `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL. Relative paths will 404. Omit the field to show the `fa-code` placeholder icon.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Internet connection (for Firestore, GitHub fetch + EmailJS)

### Running
Access the live site: https://devssst.github.io/my-portfolio

### Adding a new project
1. Place an `INFO.json` at the root of the project repo
2. Add a repo entry to `portfolio/timestamp` in Firestore: `{ "repo": "devssst/your-repo" }`
3. Push `INFO.json` — the portfolio auto-fetches and renders the card

### Adding a certificate
1. Place the PNG in `data/files/`
2. Add an entry to `portfolio/certs` in Firestore under `data.certificates`
3. Push — the cert card renders automatically

## 🎨 Design Language

### Color Palette
- **Background**: Python code-art image (`background.png`), `background-attachment: fixed`
- **Overlay**: Single `body::before` — `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75)` + `backdrop-filter: blur(6px)` applied once globally
- **Header**: `rgba(17, 25, 40, 0.80)` with its own `backdrop-filter: blur(8px) saturate(180%)`
- **Cards**: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.001–0.01)` — defined primarily by borders, not fill
- **Accent Purple**: `#a855f7` / `#7c22e8` / `#c026d3`
- **Logo**: Red `#FF2200` V on black
- **Text Primary**: `#ffffff`
- **Text Muted**: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.35–0.65)`

> Per-card `backdrop-filter` is disabled (commented out) for performance. Glassmorphism is achieved via the single global overlay. Commented blocks are left intentionally for future re-enablement.

### Language Bar Colors
- **HTML**: `#E34F26` — **CSS**: `#663399` — **JavaScript**: `#F7DF1E` — **Python**: `#013763` — **Java**: `#E32C2E`

### UI Highlights
- 6-section tab navigation: `home`, `about`, `timeline`, `projects`, `certificates`, `reach`
- Mouse wheel and touch swipe section hijacking (300ms cooldown, 5px threshold) — textarea scroll is excluded
- Profile card smooth slide-out; state synced across all 4 content sections
- Purple scrollbar auto-appears on scroll, fades after 1.5s
- Animated skill bars triggered once on first ABOUT entry
- Clickable stat cards navigate to their section
- Consistent empty states: centered FA icon + muted text

## 📋 Update Logs

### Phase 3 — Firebase & Firestore Integration (May 5 2026)
- Firebase Authentication integrated
- All JSON data migrated to Firestore `portfolio` collection — `timestamp`, `certs`, `docs`, `credentials` documents
- `data/` folder reduced to `files/` only (PDFs and certificate images)
- `loadAllData()` fully rewritten to use Firestore SDK
- EmailJS credentials now loaded from Firestore at runtime

### Phase 3 — Data Architecture Refinements (May 4 2026)
- `data/projects.json` renamed to `data/timestamp.json` — now accepts both repo slugs and direct timeline entries in the same array
- `TIMELINE_DATA` constant removed from `dashboard.js` entirely — all timeline data now lives in JSON files
- `FETCHED_TIMELINE[]` added as a third data store alongside `FETCHED_PROJECTS[]` and `FETCHED_CERTS[]`
- `renderDocs()` now properly `await`-ed in `boot()` — previously called without await
- EmailJS credentials moved from hardcoded JS constants to a config file — fetched at runtime, guarded before send
- `certs-sort-btn` filter pills removed from certificates section — company group labels serve as visual separators
- Textarea scroll guard added to wheel hijack handler

### Phase 3 — Full Dashboard (May 3 2026)
- All 6 sections built and functional
- JSON-driven content: projects via `INFO.json` fetch chain, certs via `certs.json`, docs via `docs.json`
- `boot()` async with individual `try/catch` per render — crash isolation
- Profile card collapse synced across ABOUT, TIMESTAMPS, PROJECTS, CERTIFICATES
- EmailJS integrated and confirmed working
- Universal card spec applied to CV/Resume, Projects, Certificates
- Skills bar animation, levels modal, stat card navigation
- Per-element scrollbar Map — fixes shared scroll state bug

### Phase 2 — Dashboard Shell (April 28 2026)
- Dashboard HTML skeleton with 6 section anchors
- Sticky header with ADMIN/VISITOR badge and dropdown
- `switchSection()`, `loadFromStorage()`, session-based access control

### Phase 1 — Welcome Page (April 19 2026)
- Welcome page with glassmorphism card design
